# Agent Instructions

These instructions define long-term, repository-specific boundaries for agents
working on Powers Tool. Global agent rules already cover communication,
planning, simple and surgical changes, and text-file hygiene.

## 1. Project Context

- Read the affected code and the relevant documentation before changing
  behavior. Use the root `README.md` and `pyproject.toml` when the task concerns
  installation, packaging, entry points, dependencies, or repository layout.
- Read the relevant files in `docs/contracts/` before changing CLI/WebUI
  adapter behavior, worker or subprocess orchestration, JSON/JSONL schemas, or
  HTTP control/status contracts.
- Preserve machine-mode stdout as structured JSON or JSONL only. Human-readable
  diagnostics belong in text mode or stderr; do not emit plain-text lifecycle
  output on machine-mode stdout.
- Get user confirmation before changing contract-defined queue admission or
  rejection semantics, worker lifecycle or HTTP control behavior, process exit
  meanings, run correlation, or artifact path, privacy, redaction, publication,
  or ownership rules.
- Read `docs/webui/web-ui-change-rules.md` before changing WebUI static files or
  in-app UI behavior.

## 2. Distribution And Import Boundaries

- The root `pyproject.toml` is the single distribution metadata boundary for
  `powers-tool`. Do not recreate component-local distributions or introduce a
  `powers_tool.*` namespace without explicit user approval.
- Get user confirmation before changing public packaging boundaries: package
  name or version, dependencies or optional dependency groups, console scripts
  or entry points, build system, or Core/CLI/WebUI component ownership. Tool
  configuration such as pytest, ruff, or mypy may be changed when the requested
  task clearly includes it.
- Preserve the import packages `powers_tool_core`, `powers_tool_cli`, and
  `powers_tool_webui`.
- Core must not import CLI or WebUI. CLI and WebUI may depend on Core, but must
  not depend on each other.

## 3. Multi-Vendor Extension Boundary

- Keep the product identity and shared architecture vendor-neutral.
  Implementation details and user documentation may remain vendor- or
  model-specific where accurate. Validation evidence may also remain vendor-
  or model-specific, but belongs in private or separately shared review
  artifacts, not tracked public documentation.
- For future brands or models, keep capability, identification, validation,
  support-policy, and instrument-command differences primarily in Core. Keep
  detected manufacturer/model identity, canonical model tokens, stable model
  IDs, and aliases distinct; do not infer vendor or support identity by
  splitting or formatting a model ID.
- CLI and WebUI must not copy or reimplement brand/model capabilities, safety
  limits, identification rules, or instrument-command branches. They must use
  Core profile, capability, validation, and support-policy results. Pure
  presentation may be derived from Core metadata.
- Apply fail-closed behavior to live hardware paths. Product LIVE support is
  exact-scoped by canonical model ID, command, transport, backend, and required
  categorical feature. Do not infer support across models, commands,
  transports, backends, connection scopes, or feature families. Unknown,
  unidentified, mismatched, missing, unsupported, unvalidated, or
  non-Product-open scopes must not run live. Dry-run and simulator paths may
  use an explicitly selected registered profile as allowed by the existing
  contracts.
- These rules constrain future changes. Do not pre-build abstractions for an
  unsupported second vendor or refactor reasonable current model-specific code
  without a concrete requirement.

## 4. Instrument Safety

- Treat changes that can affect a live instrument or its output as high risk.
  Get user confirmation before changing output-on/off behavior,
  voltage/current application order, VISA timeouts, OVP/OCP or
  protection-clear behavior, LIST or sequence timing, trigger or wait
  strategies, remote/local behavior, or cleanup behavior.
- Keep real output off by default. Default tests must never enable hardware
  output. Automated or unattended live flows may enable output only through
  the existing contract-required configuration and per-request confirmation
  gates. Examples that enable output must use low safe values, set current
  limit before voltage, and guarantee output-off cleanup. Do not introduce
  automatic high-voltage or high-current behavior without an explicit safety
  design and user approval.
- Preserve the current stop design: `engine.stop()` only sets stop state and
  stop events; VISA I/O belongs on the worker or cleanup path.
- Preserve the cleanup order unless the task explicitly changes it: wait for
  worker, `release_to_local`, close, cleanup release, then stop the HTTP server.
- Keep concrete SCPI/driver commands and query/wait semantics in Core,
  contracts, or supported-model documentation. Verify model-specific SCPI,
  channel syntax, timing, protection behavior, and LIST, sequence, and trigger
  behavior against the relevant programming guide. Do not change or generalize
  them without model-appropriate validation and explicit approval.
- Keep VISA resource strings configurable. Never commit real resource strings,
  instrument serial numbers, or private lab addresses.

## 5. Testing And Validation

- Follow [Testing Guidelines](docs/testing-guidelines.md). Default tests must
  run without hardware; use simulators or fake instruments for command,
  validation, trigger-routing, and error-path coverage.
- Run pytest from the repository root. Run the narrowest relevant checks first,
  then broader no-hardware tests when practical.
- Match verification depth to the changed boundary. Routine documentation,
  presentation-only, test-only, and hardware-independent refactors should
  normally use focused or affected no-hardware checks; do not run full release
  acceptance merely because a change was made.
- Reserve `scripts/release-acceptance.ps1` for release, packaging, distribution,
  entry-point, comparable release-gate work, and formal release candidates. Keep
  release acceptance separate from real-instrument validation.
- Escalate to approved real-instrument validation when a change materially
  affects SCPI/driver behavior, output sequencing, VISA/backend/transport
  behavior, trigger/wait or LIST/sequence timing, protection/restore safety,
  completion pulses, or stop/release/local/cleanup behavior. Documentation-only
  and hardware-independent refactors do not normally require a hardware rerun.
- Use `.tmp_tests/` for intentional test and validation artifacts.
- Real-instrument validation must be explicit, opt-in, bounded, and use a VISA
  resource supplied by the user. Never infer, scan for, or guess a resource for
  unattended live validation. Do not describe dry-run, simulator, mocked, or
  plan-only results as real-instrument validation.
- If the full test suite is blocked by environment permissions, report the
  limitation and the focused checks that ran. Live validation is not a
  substitute and should run only when live behavior is in scope and approved.
- Report every failed, skipped, blocked, or unexecuted verification step.

## 6. Documentation Boundary

- Keep tracked documentation durable, public, and free of temporary planning,
  transient validation, review, or promotion status, private operator context,
  and run-specific validation results, records, evidence, or artifacts.
- Keep `USER_GUIDE.md` files operator-facing. Keep setup, build, maintainer,
  validation workflow and requirements, and detailed engineering material in
  `README.md` or focused contributor documentation. Include in `USER_GUIDE.md`
  only the minimum information required for normal user operation.
- English documentation remains the default unless localized docs are
  explicitly in scope. When a maintained USER_GUIDE or Supported Models
  Markdown source that feeds bundled Help changes, regenerate Help using the
  existing generator and synchronize only the generated assets owned by the
  affected runtime surface(s). Generated Help HTML must not be manually
  maintained as a second documentation source.
- Do not place personal filesystem paths, real VISA resources, instrument
  serial numbers, private lab addresses, or link-local/private network
  addresses in tracked public documentation.
- Operator-facing and product-support documentation must not include internal
  phase names, candidate evidence, unperformed validation, review or promotion
  status or plans, or temporary laboratory-specific context.
